    <h2 id="sec2">– The first languages (Complex) –</h2>
    <p>One of the first languages ever recorded was summerian about 3200BCE and Egyptian Hieroglyphics around 3000 BCE  Other languages like Akkadian emerged sometime around 2500 BCE, however most common modern languages only emerged until later because they are the result of hundreds and hundreds of years were languages evolved as time passed, with some exceptions like Chinese and others that are pretty old languages, but even these languages have had changes over time. However humans had had since way before a way to communicate and interact with each other.</p>

    <h2 id="sec3">– How languages evolve –</h2>
    <p>Languages evolve over time for many reasons some being: wars, cultural diffusion , culture, advancements in technology and many more, this is because just like how humans learn and adapt to our surroundings we also adapted languages to fit our needs and sometimes forced others to change their language this happens a lot during war or the discoverment of tribes which most of the time leads to war or to slavery. Languages evolving is key for mankind as we constantly get better and better at communicating allowing us to orchestrate very detailed and down to the millisecond operations.</p>

    <h2 id="sec4">– What are the benefits of language? –</h2>
    <p>Languages have sprouted many times throughout the world because of one of the most fundamental things that separate us humans from monkeys or horses and that is our ability to set goals for the future and unite a large group of people who we can express our ideas to. Humans are naturally social creatures. We have a drive to be accepted by the community and for that reason languages are a key direct contributor to being able to thrive. Also because we could express our ideas more we were able to coordinate, split our jobs, hunt and kill creatures magnitudes bigger than the average human and pass down knowledge. Before it was either to communicate well or get eaten and so naturally humans became a social creature.</p>

    <h2 id="sec5">– Non verbal communication –</h2>
    <p>Talking has not been the only way of communication for a long time of history, painting, pointing and even morse code are all different ways of communicating that humans have invented, Humans have not only been communicating verbally but rather they have been communicating in countless different ways all that serve a purpose:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Art:</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Art has been used through history in order to communicate and pass down information to younger generations,</li>
         <li>Art has allowed humans to express themselves in a colorful abstract way that is not very easy to do with verbal communication,</li>
         <li>Art has been around humans as early as 40,000 years ago helping us express ourselves and adapt to the world around us.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Secret code:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Secrets have always been a part of human nature for purposes to either protect ourselves or the people around us, that is why many different types of secret codes have been made throughout history </li>
        <li>Codes like Morse code started in early 1800 by Samuel Morse and Alfred vail these codes were used with a series of quick and long beeps to represent the english alphabet</li>
        <li>Codes have been around us for a long time and they could arguably be just as important as saying the truth, because for wars and secret operations they have been used throughout history</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Signaling:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Signaling has been used by humanity for ages, we have since the beginning used our hands to point at stuff and to communicate.</li>
        <li>Many deaf people communicate via signals and understand the world around them via these signals, furthermore signaling is core in the nature of communication as it is almost impossible to communicate without doing any type of hand movement.</li>
        <li>A signal is basically anything that we do with our bodies in order to communicate more efficiently, for example facial expression is one kind of signal and a very important one.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="sec6">– Modern communication–</h2>
    <p>As humans, cultures and empires evolved so did communication and language so as of today our language is an incredibly complex tool we humans have and with signaling we can orchestrate the biggest most efficient way to thrive. But that raises the question till what point has communication and language gone? How far have we abused this magnificent skill we were granted?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Humans have exploited language and communication expanding to over 7,000 languages this shows just how critical languages are for humanity and how important language has become in the modern world</li>
      <li>Also nowadays over 4.88 Billion people have phones meaning they can communicate instantly to the other side of the world, a power never seen before in human history, right now given the fact that it's easy to communicate with someone in China if you are in Chile makes technological and social advancements tenfold.</li>
      <li>Before books might have been used to pass down information for generations or scrolls and maybe even legends but in today's world you have every ounce of knowledge that has ever prevented itself on humans in your tablet this exponentially increases every single aspect of research from social to marine to space!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="sec7">– The industrial revolution and its effect on communication –</h2>
    <p>Ever since the industrial revolution in the 1760 communication and language has drastically changed as humans got extremely interconnected and started messaging each other in long distances, the first telephone was made in 1876 but telegraphs were used before to communicate ideas furthermore because of the explosion of the industrial revolution the world became interconnected and people became even more connected with each other exponentially increasing cultural diffusion and many ways of communication. In the industrial revolution technology took over a lot of the world and so did different producing technologies and techniques, lastly with the invention of long distance communication humans are no longer bound by distance in terms of communication, increasing knowledge and culture.</p>

    <h2 id="sec8">– Conclusion –</h1>
    <p>  In the end communication and technology have drawn a pathway for us to thrive as a social species and we use it.  The world is different than before, for both the good and bad, wars kill more people, vaccines save countless lives, nukes incinerate cities, we launch giant blocks of heavy steel into the atmosphere. All thanks to the fact that we are social creatures and so from the first language to morse code humanity has thrived and improved and so has our communication and language skills, and we see no evidence of it stopping any time soon.</p>
